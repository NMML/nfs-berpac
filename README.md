# Northern Fur Seal Movement, Dive Behavior, and Oceanography in the Bering Sea and Pacific Ocean

<!-- badges: start -->

## Project Summary

In 2018, the AFSC Polar Ecosystems Program and Wildlife Computers began
collaboration on a project to develop a new family of SPLASH bio-loggers
that would provide a small footprint device capable of FastLoc GPS,
ocean temperature profiles, and on-board dive behavior summaries that
provide unbiased data and efficient transmission via Argos. Due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, the intended deployments on ribbon and spotted seals
in 2020 were not possible, and in the spring of 2022, only 2 of the 25
devices available were deployed. Instead of letting these devices sit on
the shelf for 2+ years, we have developed a plan to deploy a portion of
them on northern fur seals at San Miguel Island and northern fur seals
at St. Paul Island. At least 10 devices will be reserved for future
deployments on ice seals via collaborative research with Alaska Native
communities. These tags were originally funded by the US Navy in 2017.

These tags employ two key enhancements that have not been previously
available:

1.  Improved ocean temperature profile capabilities with a dedicated
    external thermistor probe
2.  On-board processing of time-at-depth data to create a more efficient
    dive behavior summary message that relies on empirical cumulative
    distributions instead of the typical histogram bin approach used for
    decades.

Because relatively few devices with these new capabilities have been
deployed (by MML or other researchers), there is a great need to observe
how these new devices perform, to evaluate how efficient the data
transmissions are, and to learn from real-world experience so future
deployments can be optimized for a range of study questions.

## Deployment Details

In September 2022, SPLASH bio-loggers were deployed on 12 adult female
northern fur seals at San Miguel Island, California (n=6) and St. Paul
Island, Alaska (n=6).
